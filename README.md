## 👋 About Me

I am a computer vision and medical imaging researcher passionate about building AI-driven solutions that enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce radiation dose, and improve healthcare accessibility.  
My work primarily focuses on:

- Low-Dose CT Reconstruction  
- Diffusion Models & GANs  
- Retinal Vessel Segmentation  
- Physics-Guided Deep Learning  
- Contrastive Learning for Medical Imaging

I have authored and co-authored multiple papers, including one accepted at PRCV 2025, and several journal and conference submissions to IEEE TMI, CVPR, PeerJ Computer Science, and BIBM.
